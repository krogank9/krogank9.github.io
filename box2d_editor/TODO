To complete the program:
1. Make the player interactive, pan+zoom & mouse joint
2. Add collision filtering

Extras:
1. clean up code in general, variable function names etc. it's pretty messy in a lot of places
2. add more tools. needs polygon tool
3. add more joints such as rope and distance joints until all joints are supported
4. find a new webgl renderer other than pixi.js, or make it run more efficiently, it's slow.
5. make the box2d player more functional. need to be able to grab and throw bodies around.
6. add support for images like RUBE does
7. add a circle tool
8. add support for editing fixtures, vertices, groups
9. maybe a properties window like RUBE for more precise positioning and editing various properties
