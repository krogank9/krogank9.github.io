To complete the program:
1. Add collision filtering

Extras:
1. write a webgl renderer specifically for the program to optimize as much as possible
2. combine the player and the editor windows, use the same renderer

3. clean up code in general, variable function names etc. it's pretty messy in a lot of places

4. add more tools. needs polygon tool
5. add more joints such as rope and distance joints until all joints are supported

7. add support for images like RUBE does
8. add a circle tool

9. add support for editing fixtures, vertices, groups
10. maybe a properties window like RUBE for more precise positioning and editing various properties
